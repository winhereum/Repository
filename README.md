The Decentralized Betting Pay Defi Ecosystem

PROBLEM OVERVIEW

The betting industry has lacked innovative ideas for some time and betting industry is plagued by multiple problems. The estimated scale of the traditional sports betting market (including both legal and illegal bets, internationally) is in the trillions of USD.
An estimated $400 billion dollars illegal bets are placed annually in the United States alone. China’s illegal betting market is even more extensive.

Betting companies operate under a shade of secrecy, not letting customers know how odds are created or how much money is poured in. Some even manipulate odds after a game starts. There is a lack of high fees and intermediaries, security, lack of privacy, extortionate fees and low returns and payment methods are outdated and regularly winning players are restricted or banned. Traditional sports betting in many locales is driven underground, leading to corruption, unfairness, and violence.

All of these problems are a direct result of one simple fact: the current online betting market is highly centralized. Centralized companies are in charge of the markets, the outcomes, the odds, and even the funds of the players. At the same time, these companies are struggling with strict regulations, frozen assets, and high safety requirements.
These factors alienate a significant number of potential bettors from taking part in such systems. Blockchain technology can provide a solution encompassing all the above features decentralization, unprecedented security against, fraud, hacking, transparency, and as much support/versatility as the designer chooses to incorporate.
Winhereum offers this untapped market the opportunity to choose a safe, private, and accessible way to bet through decentralized blockchain technology.
